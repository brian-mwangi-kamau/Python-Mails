# Python-Mails
This is a Python script for sending Mails with Gmail.

I built this as practice for another project I was building at the time of creating this.
I figured I should create a repo for it.

The script works fine.
You are likely to face an error with the use of the sender's email account since Google bars low-level apps.
To solve that, activate Google 2FA on the sender account and generate an 'App password' which you'll then use, instead of the default password.
